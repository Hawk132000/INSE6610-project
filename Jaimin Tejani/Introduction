Introduction

The increase in the use of Internet Technology(IT) and the Internet of Things(IoT) has also increased the incidents and risks of cyber attacks. It is however, extremely difficult to prevent zero day attacks. For the purpose of identifying the attack and the attacker cybercrime investigation is necessary. Cybercrime investigations help in detecting patterns for future attack and create strategies to build a defense response. A cybercrime investigation is the process of investigating, analyzing and recovering critical forensic digital data from the networks involved in the attack.[1]
For this, several forensic tools can be utilized which can be broadly classified as hardware and software tools. Hardware tools mainly provide data extraction, data recovery, data encryption, metadata examination, data carving, link analysis and malware analysis functionalities. There are various software tools that support digital forensic, network forensics, malware analysis, memory forensics, log analysis, incident response, open source intelligence(OSINT), data recovery, encryption-decryption and steganography tools. For the survey, we reviewed several tools including EnCase, IDA Pro, Wireshark, etc. 
The cybercrime investigation is mostly performed by criminal justice agencies, national security agencies and private security agencies. In the report we have further surveyed topics covering comparative analysis between software and hardware tools, legal and ethical considerations, emerging trends and challenges and future recommendations.
